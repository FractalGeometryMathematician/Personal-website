I was walking with my friend yesterday when we started discussing the financial situation of most Americans, especially in regards to college loans, which on average put a student in debt by $38k and typically take nearly 18 years to pay of. This eventually lead us to wonder about how much income the average person makes in their lifetime, and how much a college degree truly assists in their earnings.

Typically, Americans with a high school diploma make about $40k a year. Those with a bachelors degree make $80k.

Those who enter the workforce at the age of 18 typically work for 46 years, while college grads do so for 42. Most Americans tend to delay their retirement to achieve Social Security benefits, at around 64 years of age.

That means throughout their careers, non-diploma holders will receive $1,840,000 in income, while bachelor degree holders will accumulate $3,360,000, pre taxes, expenses, and all other costs of living.

Let's analyze how taxes will affect these numbers. In 2024, singles with $40k annual income had to pay about 12% in income taxes, while those earning $80k lost 22%. That brings their total career incomes down to respectively $1,619,200 and $2,620,800.

Now let's look at normal, day to day expenses. Average yearly expenses were close to $44,000 annually in 2022, so multiplied out across the earning years of Americans (and four years of college), this comes close to $2,464,000 in expenses. What's surprising is that high school graduates makes less money than their daily expenses, even without taxes. Of course, this is a general average of everybody's expenses, including from the ultra-rich to the most unfortunate person, so the expenses for this particular group would be a bit lower, but still in a precarious financial situation.

Of course, no college grad can ever forget about factoring their college loan into their expenses. As said in the beginning, college debts are usually around $38k. With other expenses factored out of a college degree holders expenses throughout their working years, they would have $156,800. Subtract their college loan and $118,000 remains.

After analyzing these numbers, the cost of life in relation to average earnings for the two groups becomes stark. A single high school graduate would already struggle tremendously with his day to day necessities and expenses, which match or overshadow his paycheck. A bachelor degree holder would fare better, but would still have to live a modest life. Though he may hold $118,000 on paper, other unaccounted expenses do exist. A new car could cost $35,000, medical bills will occasionally break their bank and of course, the theoretical person in this situation is a renter, and has not and is unable to buy a house costing on average $412,000. And keep in mind this is a single person. Imagine a family consisting of two bachelor degrees. Yes, there would be two earners, but they would also have to care for several children as well, and all the expenses that come with them.

Overall, a bachelor/college degree definitely improves quality of life and income for it's holder. However, it still doesn't offer a decent or better quality of live as one might want and expect to comfortably live and build a family. Being a high school graduate puts you in an even worse state, as you are barely even able to pay for your own bills, much less a whole families. Its depressing to see how essentials and basic necessities occupy so much of a person's paycheck, forcing them to give up on other aspects of life and burdening their financial situation in such a heavy manner.
